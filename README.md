## Movie Recommendation System 
This project is a Movie Recommendation System designed to suggest movies based on user preferences and behavior. It uses various recommendation algorithms and data processing techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations.

## Features:
### Data Collection:
Utilizes movie datasets such as MovieLens or IMDB, including movie ratings, genres, and user preferences.
### Data Preprocessing:
Cleans and preprocesses data, including handling missing values,removing stopwords punctuation marks, grammar correction and encoding categorical features..
### Modeling:
Implemented various machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
### Deep Learning Approach:
Optional extension using LSTM/RNN with TensorFlow/Keras for more sophisticated sentiment analysis.
### Evaluation:
Models evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
### Deployment:
The project includes a simple web interface (optional, Flask/Django) to allow users to input their reviews and receive sentiment predictions.
Getting Started:
## Clone the repository.
Install the required packages from requirements.txt.
Run the model training script or load the pre-trained model.
(Optional) Start the web application by running app.py.
This description covers key aspects of the project, from data handling to model deployment. Adjust it based on your specific implementation and tools used.
